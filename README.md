Spring backend for blog

## Milestones
- Use "MappedBy" on all relational annotations (@OneToMany, etc)
- Create a GET, POST, PUT, DELETE method for each controller. Look at User/Post for example
- Create POSTMAN for each call with Sample data.
- Get Familiar with lookup scenarios for Service methods/endpoints. (i.e. Lookup a post you get the user "author" information as well as comments, tags. You may want to lookup all posts with a particular Author, or All Comments by an Author, etc)
